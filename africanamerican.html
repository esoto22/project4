       <p>Day after day black people are stereotyped as thugs, that they eat chicken and watermelon and grape soda, they are made fun of and called monkeys because of there facial features and they are always asked "can I touch your hair" these stereotypes that people give them makes them feel offended it hurts their self esteem and it makes it hard for them to get jobs sometimes because people right away assume they've had an interaction with the law. You need to stop this. You need to defend them break prejudice and make a change. </p>

	<p>The world would be so much better if society stops putting people into categories and containers full of stereotypes. Break prejudice and be the change you want to see in the world.
